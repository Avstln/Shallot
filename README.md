# SLIVER: Streamlined Lightweight Infrastructure for Vulnerability Exploration & Research

## Introduction

**Sliver** is a lightweight Docker-based environment designed for researchers to explore vulnerabilities and conduct security research in a controlled, minimalistic setup. By leveraging Docker Compose and a simplified ELK stack, Sliver provides an easily deployable, streamlined infrastructure for vulnerability analysis, without the overhead of a full-scale security solution.

## Project Goals

- Provide a minimal, scalable environment for vulnerability research.
- Offer a simple, lightweight setup with essential tools for exploration.
- Enable researchers to:
  - Test security tools in real-time.
  - Simulate basic environments for vulnerability exploration.
  - Analyze potential exploits in a controlled lab setting.

## Benefits

- **Lightweight:** Minimal resource requirements, designed for quick deployment and testing.
- **Flexible:** Easily adaptable for specific research tools and needs.
- **Portable:** Docker-compose allows for fast setup and teardown, enabling experimentation across various environments.
- **Focused on Research:** Designed to assist in vulnerability exploration without the distractions of unnecessary tools.

## Getting Started

This repository contains Docker Compose files and configurations to quickly spin up a lightweight ELK stack environment for research purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Docker and Docker Compose.
- Basic understanding of ELK stack components (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- Ability to configure and extend the setup for custom research needs.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sliver.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd sliver`

3. Start the environment using Docker Compose:  
   `docker-compose up -d`

4. Access Kibana through your browser:  
   `http://localhost:5601`

5. Begin adding data or configuring the stack to suit your research purposes.

## Additional Tools

Sliver includes basic ELK stack components but can be extended with additional tools as needed for specific vulnerability research tasks.
